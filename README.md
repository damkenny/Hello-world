# My Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript for me is a langauge that has a large syntax and also has a way of writing it.

I realized JavaScript has a very similar datatype to Python which data types also include boolean, strings, null value.

Now i am getting used to learning Javascript Function like Alert, Console.log, let, confirm, prompt

Creating web page using HTML and incorporating javaScript using the <script></script> tag.

Shortcut to creating an HTML 
              
              
              <!DOCTYPE html>
               <html>
               <body>
                   <script>
                    'use strict';
                      let name = prompt("What is your name?", "");
                     alert(name);
                   </script>
                </body>
                </html>


Using the function #alert automatically converts any value to a string to show it.

for the string conversion and numeric conversion

input
          
          let value = true;
          alert(typeof value);
 output      
  
           boolean
