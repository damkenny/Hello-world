# My Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript for me is a langauge that has a large syntax and also has a way of writing it.

Functions that include
#Alert, Console.log, let, confirm, prompt

Creating web page that will incorporate HTML
              
              
              <!DOCTYPE html>
               <html>
               <body>
                   <script>
                    'use strict';
                      let name = prompt("What is your name?", "");
                     alert(name);
                   </script>
                </body>
                </html>
